# Who we are

Public & Open Foundation is an independent foundation coming forth from the Foundation for Public Code, to focus on supporting public code with concrete actions in Europe.

## Goal and mission

The goal of the Public & Open Foundation is to support open collaboration and open source development of software and policy used by public administrations in order to deliver sovereign, transparent, cost-effective and lower risk digital public infrastructure.

Driven by a mission to help European public sector organizations and open source communities work together in a more effective, resilient, sustainable and scalable way.

## Activities

It does this through coaching, mentoring and workforce development, as well as codebase stewardship, community management and supporting governance. 

## The team

The initiative is spearheaded by the Founder of the Foundation for Public Code and former chief executive Boris VAN HOYTEMA, together with the codebase stewardship leadership team made up out of Eric HERMAN, also chairman of the MariaDB Foundation, and Claus MULLIE, coordinator for codebase stewardship at the Foundation For Public Code.
