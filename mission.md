# Mission

The mission of the Public & Open Foundation is to help European public sector organizations and open source communities work together in a more effective, resilient, sustainable and scalable way.

We do this by supporting open collaboration and open source development of software/policy used by public administrations. In order to deliver sovereign, transparent, cost-effective and lower risk digital public infrastructure.
