# Organization

Public & Open Foundation is an independent foundation coming forth from the [Foundation for Public Code](http://publiccode.net/), to focus on supporting public code with concrete actions in Europe.

It does this through coaching, mentoring and workforce development, as well as codebase stewardship, community management and supporting governance.
